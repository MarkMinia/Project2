##### Case Study: An airline company named Freefall Airlines does not have the best reputation, and they are trying to remedy that. They have tasked me with analyzing data from Twitter that captures people’s sentiments about various airline companies. The marketing team will use my results to come up with a brand-new advertising campaign modeled around the most positively rated airlines. My analysis would also be focusing on an airline to understand and show Freefall Airlines what to do/not to do and how to tackle these issues. 

##### Important notes: There is no Twitter data provided for Freefall Airlines.

##### Every passing second about 6,000 Tweets are posted. What are people talking about? Hopefully, how great Freefall Airlines is, right? We spend a lot of time on social media and Twitter is one of the largest platforms out there. Data is constantly collected from users for the world to see in the form of memes, food pics, and your favorite quote from your favorite book nobody has read. There are approximately 500 million Tweets per day and amidst all that nonsense there is significant value that can be extracted from that data. 

##### Customer Tweets from 2015 have been collected for analysis. These Tweets mention various airlines in the industry and are either positive, neutral, or negative in sentiment. Customer feedback can boost or damage an airlines’ reputation, so filtering through the negative remarks can provide insight into what actions should be taken. Freefall Airlines is deeply concerned about their declining reputation and wants to resolve it. This is where we step in. We’ve been tasked to analyze the top 6 airlines (in no particular order): Virgin America, US Airways, Delta, Southwest, American, and United. We want to understand what they are doing well and where they are failing. This information should also assist the marketing team as they begin planning on a brand-new marketing campaign to kick-start the rise of Freefall Airlines.
