##### Case Study: An airline company named Freefall Airlines does not have the best reputation, and they are trying to remedy that. They have tasked me with analyzing data from Twitter that captures people’s sentiments about various airline companies. The marketing team will use my results to come up with a brand-new advertising campaign modeled around the most positively rated airlines. My analysis would also be focusing on an airline to understand and show Freefall Airlines what to do/not to do and how to tackle these issues. 

##### Important notes: There is no Twitter data provided for Freefall Airlines. All insights are based on data from competing airlines and using one of them as an example for success in which Freefall Airlines would follow.

##### Every passing second about 6,000 Tweets are posted. What are people talking about? Hopefully, how great Freefall Airlines is, right? We spend a lot of time on social media and Twitter is one of the largest platforms out there. Data is constantly collected from users for the world to see in the form of memes, food pics, and your favorite quote from your favorite book nobody has read. There are approximately 500 million Tweets per day and amidst all that nonsense there is significant value that can be extracted from that data. 

##### Customer Tweets from 2015 have been collected for analysis. These Tweets mention various airlines in the industry and are either positive, neutral, or negative in sentiment. Customer feedback can boost or damage an airlines’ reputation, so filtering through the negative remarks can provide insight into what actions should be taken. Freefall Airlines is deeply concerned about their declining reputation and wants to resolve it. This is where we step in. We’ve been tasked to analyze the top 6 airlines (in no particular order): Virgin America, US Airways, Delta, Southwest, American, and United. We want to understand what they are doing well and where they are failing. This information should also assist the marketing team as they begin planning on a brand-new marketing campaign to kick-start the rise of Freefall Airlines.

##### The goal for this analysis is to look at the various airlines and identify key areas of outperformance and underperformance using data from Twitter.
- ##### There was a total of 9157 total Tweets that were considered negative.
- ##### The solid line across represents the median total Tweets per category, which is approximately 651. 
- ##### The median was used over the average due to the clear outliers of 2902 and 74. This depicts a more appropriate idea of the data distribution.
- ##### Customer service issues ranked as the top concern amongst customer Tweets. 32 percent of all negative Tweets belonged to this category and represents the number one issue for airlines in general.
- ##### Late flights ranks second as it accounted for 18 percent of all negative Tweets.
- ##### “Can’t Tell” are Tweets that the system could not recognize as a valid reason. I decided to keep it in the data because the Negative Reason Confidence average for this group was 0.62, which means Twitter is fairly confident the Tweet recorded is negative. Removing this would skew the sentiment. 
- ##### Cancelled flight (9 percent) and lost luggage (8 percent) are both considerably less than the customer service count, but are still considered major issues being above the median and should be addressed.
- ##### Bad flight (6 percent), Flight booking problems (6 percent), and flight attendant complaints (5 percent) are just below the median, which is a sign that the airlines are taking proper measures to resolve and control these issues, but they should still be mindful of them.
- ##### Longlines (2 percent) and damaged luggage (1 percent) both come in at the bottom two. The airlines are doing a great job tackling those two issues and ensuring complaints are kept at a minimum.
